# Architecture

FleetIQ is an asset-centric platform. Its core model supports multiple industries
and treats locomotives as one prospective configuration rather than a universal
domain assumption.

The principal boundaries are:

1. A protocol layer turns bytes from an identified communication device into
   source observations while preserving provenance.
2. A semantic layer binds source observations to typed properties of physical
   assets for an effective time interval.
3. A telemetry layer stores current and historical observations and supplies
   bounded queries.
4. An application layer implements asset management, calculations, alerts,
   commands, and user-facing workflows.
5. Adapters integrate transports, persistence, brokers, identity providers, and
   object storage without leaking them into the domain model.

The initial runtime topology and technology choices remain subject to focused
ADRs and measured prototypes. See the source redesign documents until their
accepted parts are migrated into this repository.

## Semantic asset foundation

An `Asset` is an industry-neutral physical or logical thing owned by one tenant.
Its configurable asset type supplies domain meaning; FleetIQ does not compile a
fixed list such as vehicle, locomotive, motor, or sensor into the core aggregate.

External identifiers consist of a kind, an optional issuing authority, and a
value. VIN, IMEI, serial number, and operator number can therefore coexist
without making any one identifier universal. The asset aggregate prevents exact
duplicates. Cross-asset uniqueness requires tenant-wide repository knowledge and
will be enforced when persistence is introduced.

Asset-type definitions are immutable and versioned. An asset references a
specific version, preventing a later configuration change from silently changing
its meaning. Each asset-type version also pins the version of every supported
property definition.

Property definitions are reusable across asset types and declare a storage-level
value kind plus an optional canonical unit for numeric values. Calculators can
therefore target semantic property IDs rather than vendor-specific fields. Unit
identifiers are configurable so adopting a standard vocabulary does not require
changing the core domain model.

Asset relationships, device endpoints, and effective-time signal bindings are
separate concepts planned for subsequent increments.
